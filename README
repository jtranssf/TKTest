Thomas Kilmann Conflict Personality Test. 

This is an Ionic mobile app that also runs in your Chrome browser.  


If you would like to preview the app, use Cloud 9 IDE's terminal and 
follow the commands below to install the correct version of node, cordova
and ionic.  

git clone https://github.com/jtranssf/TKTest.git
cd TKTest
nvm install 6.9.4 
nvm use alias 6.9.4
npm install -g ionic cordova
ionic serve -p 8080 --nolivereload 


 (line 17: -p stands for port, so change it accordingly)
